You've gotta a lotta lotta nerve

Coming here when I'm still with him
And I can't have you, it isn't fair
Born March of '86, my birthday's coming
And if I had one wish, yeah, you'd be it

When you're 'round
I lose myself inside your mouth
You've got brown eyes like no one else
Baby, make it to me

Again and again, again, again, again, again
Never stop
Again and again, again, again, again, again
Never stop, oh

He never really saw me
Or waited when we were hooking up
Yeah, he'd a never last

Last week when I was sad
You said that you knew
My eyes change from kinda green
To kind blue, heya

When you're 'round
I lose myself inside your mouth
You've got brown eyes like no one else
Baby, make it to me

Again and again, again, again, again, again
Never stop
Again and again, again, again, again, again
Never stop, oh

They tell me if I leave him
Baby, would you be there?
'Cause maybe you could
Be m-m-mine all the t-t-time



I'm beautiful in my way
Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track
Baby I was born this way.



One look and I'm done
One glance from your eyes
And I'm captivated

The taste of your skin
The warmth of your hungry lips
Has me so taken and I
Love the way you can make me dance
From miles away

When I'm with you I'm so sedated
I'm captivated by you

You're just like the wind 'cuz
Everything moves away when you're around it

The sun is just like the sound of
your voice in the morning
When you light my world up and I
Love the way you can make me dance From miles away

When I'm with you I'm never jaded,
I'm captivated 



Ooh ooh ohh
oh oh oh
Ooh ooh ohh
oh oh oh
oooh oh oh oooh oh oh
ooh ooh ooh ooh

I, need somebody who calls my name
When clouds are smokin up my way
You get me through these ch-changing skies

I, don't wanna be afraid again
It's just that I could use a friend
You get me through these ch-changing skies

Give me something that I
Can wrestle to the ground
There isnt anything that I can't handle now. We're out
Believe me when I say
That I Will Be Okay
And listen that's advised
and my Ch-Changing skies

Changing skies
Ch-ch-ch-changing
Changing skies
Ch-ch-ch-changing
Changing skies
Changing skies
Changing skies
Ch-ch-ch-changing

Ooh ooh ohh
oh oh oh 



Silicone, saline, poison, inject me, baby
I'm a free bitch
I'm a free bitch

Some girls won't dance to the beat of the track
She won't walk away, but she won't look back
She looks good, but her boyfriend says she's a mess
She's a mess, she's a mess, now the girl is stressed
She's a mess, she's a mess, she's a mess, she's a mess

Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he's lookin' she falls apart
Baby loves to dance in the dark

Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he's lookin' she falls apart
Baby loves to dance, loves to dance in the dark

Run, run her kiss is a vampire grin
The moon lights away while she's howlin' at him
She looks good, but her boyfriend says she's a tramp
She's a tramp, she's a vamp, but she still does her dance
She's a tramp, she's a vamp, but she still kills the dance

Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he's lookin' she falls apart
Baby loves to dance in the dark

Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he's lookin' she falls apart
Baby loves to dance, loves to dance in the dark
In the dark, she loves to dance in the dark
In the dark, she loves, she loves to dance in the dark

Marilyn, Judy, Sylvia, tell 'em how you feel, girls
Work your blond, Benet Ramsey will haunt like Liberace
Find your freedom in the music
Find your Jesus, find your Kubrick

You will never fall apart
Diana you're still in our hearts
Never let you fall apart
Together we'll dance in the dark

Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he's lookin' she falls apart
Baby loves to dance in the dark, baby

Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he's lookin' she falls apart
Baby loves to dance, loves to dance in the dark
In the dark

I don't know why you're hurt inside
Or what was said to make you cry
I hope that you can see
You are the greatest thing to me and when
You feel like your not enough
I'll give you wings I'll lift you up
I hope that you can see you are
The greatest, greatest thing to me

I don't wanna waste another day
And took hand off you up in the middle of the day ?
What I can see is you waste another day

Cuz when Im with you I fall apart,
I see your permanently broken heart.

Baby, your the greatest to me,
No, no matter what, what, what

I don't know why you're hurt inside
Or what was said to make you cry
I hope that you can see you are the greatest
Thing to me and when anekatips
You feel like your not enough
I'll give you wings I'll lift you up
I hope that you can see you are the greatest
Greatest thing to me



RedOne, Konvict
GaGa, oh-oh, eh

I've had a little bit too much, much
All of the people start to rush, start to rush by
How does he twist the dance? Can't find a drink, oh man
Where are my keys? I lost my phone, phone

What's going on on the floor?
I love this record baby but I can't see straight anymore
Keep it cool, what's the name of this club?
I can't remember but it's alright, a-alright

Just dance, gonna be okay, da da doo-doo-mmm
Just dance, spin that record babe, da da doo-doo-mmm
Just dance, gonna be okay, d-d-d-dance
Dance, dance, just, j-j-just dance

How'd I turn my shirt inside out? Inside outright
Control your poison babe, roses have thorns they say
And we're all getting hosed tonight, oh oh oh-oh

What's going on on the floor?
I love this record baby but I can't see straight anymore
Keep it cool, what's the name of this club?

When I come through on the dance floor checkin' out that catalog
Can't believe my eyes, so many women without a flaw
And I ain't gon' give it up, steady tryin' to pick it up like a car
I'ma hit it, I'ma hit it and flex and do it until tomorr' yeah

Shawty I can see that you got so much energy
The way you're twirlin' up them hips 'round and 'round
And now there's no reason at all why you can't leave here with me
In the meantime stay and let me watch you break it down

We are the crowd
We're co-coming out
Got my flash on, it's true
Need that picture of you

It's so magical
We'd be so fantastical

Leather and jeans
Garage glamorous
Not sure what it means
But this photo of us

It don't have a price
Ready for those flashing lights
'Cause you know that, baby, I

I'm your biggest fan
I'll follow you until you love me
Papa-paparazzi

Baby, there's no other superstar
You know that I'll be
Papa-paparazzi

Promise I'll be kind
But I won't stop
Until that boy is mine

Baby, you'll be famous
Chase you down until you love me
Papa-paparazzi

I'll be your girl
Backstage at your show
Velvet ropes and guitars
Yeah, 'cause you know I'm starting

Between the sets
Eyeliner and all the rest

Shadow is burnt
Yellow dance in return
My lashes are dry
Purple teardrops I cry

It don't have a price
Loving you is cherry pie
'Cause you know that, baby, I

I'm your biggest fan
I'll follow you until you love me
Papa-paparazzi

Baby, there's no other superstar
You know that I'll be
Papa-paparazzi

Promise I'll be kind
But I won't stop
Until that boy is mine

Baby, you'll be famous
Chase you down until you love me
Papa-paparazzi

Real good
We're dancin' in the studio
Stop, stop
That song on the radio

Don't stop
For anyone
We're plastic but
We'll still have fun

I'm your biggest fan
I'll follow you until you love me
Papa-paparazzi

Baby, there's no other superstar
You know that I'll be
Papa-paparazzi

Promise I'll be kind
But I won't stop
Until that boy is mine

Baby, you'll be famous
Chase you down until you love me
Papa-paparazzi



Ow, come here boy

I met a drummer last week
At a pool bar, down b-by the shore
With a body like that, and your stone washed eyes
I want you more

He cried, "Mother! What'd you do to me?"
I said, "Mother mother mother's for babies
Call me kitty."

Yeah

Shake your kitty
Shake your kitty meow
Put your arms around me, babe
I'm giving you permission to feel me

Shake your kitty
Shake your kitty meow
Put your arms around me, babe
I'm giving you permission to feel me

Shake your shake
Shake shake
Shake your sh-shake
Shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake

I took a drummer by the hand
To the juke box then
We hit the floor
With your Van Halen pin
And your dark side burns
I want you more

He cried, "Mother! What'd you do to me?"
I said, "Mother mother mother's for babies
Call me kitty."

Oh, why dontcha

Shake your kitty
Shake your kitty meow
Put your arms around me, babe
I'm giving you permission to feel me 

Shake your kitty
Shake your kitty meow
Put your arms around me, babe

You never call me by my name
But I still want you
You play some pretty tricky games
But I still want you
Your best friend drives a fancy car
But I still want you
You're working every hour
But, but I still want you yeah!

If you see a girl this pretty
Shake her, shake her, shake that kitty
When you see a girl that's pretty

Shake your kitty meow

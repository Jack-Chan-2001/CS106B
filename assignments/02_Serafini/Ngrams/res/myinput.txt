This file is empty for now, but you should delete this initial text
and replace it with your own creative input file representing a
fun input for your N-grams program.
The file can be most anything you like; maybe copy/paste the
contents of a web page you like, or write some text of your own.
It should be your own file that is different from the
other provided starter input files.
